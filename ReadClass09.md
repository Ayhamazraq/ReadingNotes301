# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING



**functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.**

***



**The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a program's execution. It must only depend on its input arguments.**

***

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

* They’re easier to reason about.
* They’re easier to combine.
* They’re easier to test.


***

## What is immutability?

* immutability is important to make our functions more consistent and predictable.

* Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

***

## What is Referential transparency?

**Referential transparency and opacity are characteristics of computer program components. Referentially transparent expressions can be substituted with their equivalent values without affecting the program's behavior.**

***

## What is a module?

**Is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.**

***

## What does the word ‘require’ do?

**`require() is used to consume modules.` It allows you to include modules in your app. You can add built-in core Node. js modules, community-based modules (node_modules), and local modules too.**

***

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

**we need to import the module. we will use the require keyword at the top of the file. The result of require is then stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation.**
